# Aptly

When trying to update several computers in local network (without internet connection) aptly is a convinient solution.

You can either create a mirror of remote repositories or build your desired repository from deb files.
Aptly snapshot option allows you to transition your package environment to a new version, or rollback to a previous version.

After publishing a snapshot, you can use apt tool in order to install packages.
